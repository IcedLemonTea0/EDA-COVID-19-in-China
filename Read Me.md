# Introduction

**COVID-19 (Coronavirus)**

Corona virus is a family of SARS that has a characteristics of 'spikes' around the surface of the virus which gives off a crown-like appearance. The corona virus that we're dealing today isn't the first major global pandemic that the world have experienced. In fact, we can recall back in China on 2002 when we dealt with SARS, and in the middle east with the MERS pandemic in 2012. There are various types of unnamed SARS out there that are simply just called 'common flu'. COVID-19 is a short form of (co)rona-(vi)rus-(d)isease-20(19).

**China**

On November 2019, first case of COVID-19 was reported in the city of Wuhan in China. At this time, CDC does not know the exact source of the outbreak but did reported that the traces of infections were linked to live animals.

In mid-january, China introduced an unprecedented measure to contain the virus by restricting human interaction in Wuhan region. Measures such as stopping flights, trains, and limiting unessential movement forced roughly 760 million Chinese citizens confined to their homes for months.

Inevitably, the spread of infection had already occured prior to lockdown. In result, China lead the number of positive and deaths cases in the beginning phase of this pandemic.

**Motivation**

My motivation for this analysis is to unravel how well and effective this lockdown has been. Being that China is the first country to respond to this pandemic, we can glance how China has been successfull in containment. Particularly, I am curious to see the effect of how extreme lockdown and isolation has on the rate of deaths and confirmed cases.

**Goal:**
* Basic Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Datasets from Mainland China from Jan 23rd 2020 onwards
* We'll look at the deaths, confirmed, and recovered cases over time to understand trends/behavior and figure the most impacted region in China.
* We will also explore the growth of new cases through period of time to determine if the new cases are decreasing or increasing relative to the size of cases.
* We will use Data Visualization libraries to convey visuals intrepretation for our goal.

*I am not epidemiologist or virologists nor have the expertise of the actual people in the field of healthcare who are more qualified in this subject matter. This report is purely an exploratory practice to enhance my skills in the areas of data analytics and to build my portfolio. The project will use publicly obtained datasets primarily for data visualization, NOT forecasts or prediction.*
